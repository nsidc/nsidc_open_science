## Links
### Data Archives
Metadata and data from federally funded research must be deposited in a long-lived, publically accessible archive.  The links below are for recognized archives.  

[Arctic Data Center](https://arcticdata.io/submit/).  The default archive for NSF-funded Arctic research.  
[Antarctic Data Center](https://www.usap-dc.org/submit).  The default archive for NSF-funded Antarctic research.  
[NSIDC](https://nsidc.org/data/submit-data).  NSIDC DAAC accepts NASA-funded unassigned (i.e. non-mission) data.  

[zenodo.org](https://zenodo.org/)  Alternative archive.  Can also be used to archive papers, presentations, and code.     
[Pangaea](https://pangaea.de/about/)  Data publisher for Earth and environmental science at Alfred Wegner Institute.
