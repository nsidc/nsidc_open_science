# Tactics for moving towards Open Science at NSIDC

- Make all published NSIDC research papers Open Access by publishing in Open Access
  journals or placing copies of papers on institutional websites in accordance with
  publishers.
  - _Add links to main publishers Open Access Guidance_
  - Investigate having NSIDC publications page on website
- Make research data used in publications Findable (DOI), Accessible (archived in public
  repository), Interoperable, and Reusable ([FAIR
  definition](https://force11.org/info/the-fair-data-principles/))
- Work with Developers to create training and how-to pages. Also create space for Open
  Science stories/guides from Science Team.
- Make research software/computer code available to the communnity
  - This should include code created for all steps of the research cycle: getting data,
    cleaning data, analyzing data, making figures.
- Establish a series of structured group discussions facilitating NSIDC's Open Science
  transition
- Develop infrastructure and practices necessary to do Open Science by default (e.g.
  levels of service).
- Develop broad proficiency with version control (Git & GitHub) on the science team and
  technical teams.
- Establish standards for citing all contributors to a work product.
